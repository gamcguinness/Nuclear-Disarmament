    <p>The Solution: Disarmament</p>
  </div>
  <div class="ekun24">
    <p>The solution to nuclear armament is the full disarmament of nuclear weapons. Disarmament is tricky to do and requires a multifaceted approach. First, a arms control agreement would need to be negotiated between armed nations. This agreement would have to come to the complete destruction of all nuclear artillery. All countries would have to agree to completely disarm to eliminate the domestic security risk of needing to arm for defence. This would also include checks to ensure any nation isnâ€™t pretending to have disarmed. Next, the construction and deployment of nuclear weapons would need to be outlawed to prevent any nation or organisation to rearm themselves. Then, all research and papers on the current information on how to construct a nuclear would need to be destroyed so any persons who wants to construct a nuclear weapon would need to build it from scratch. Finally, the retention and obtention of Uranium and Radium would need to become closely monitored to prevent the construction on nuclear weapons.
